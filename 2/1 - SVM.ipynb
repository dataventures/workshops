    "One of the reasons why SVMs can be so powerful is their ability to utilize the kernel trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Lagrangian optimization of the margin, the solution depends only on the inputs through the term $\\phi(x)^T\\phi(z)$. A Kernel is defined simply as a function that takes in two vectors of the input space and outputs a scalar representing some similarity metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, a kernel function $K$ is defined such that $K(x, z) = \\phi(x)^T\\phi(z)$ for some feature representation $\\phi$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The power of kernels is that certain feature representations result in kernels that can be expressed in a closed form. For example, the RBF kernel, $K(x, z) = \\phi_{RBF}(x)^T\\phi_{RBF}(z)$ can be simplified as $K(x, z) = \\exp(-||x - z||^2)$. $\\phi_{RBF}(x)$ is an infinite dimension feature representation that would be impossible to calculate for each input $x$, but the key here is that *we don't actually have to calculate this feature representation* since we only deal with terms of the form $\\phi_{RBF}(x)^T\\phi_{RBF}(z)$, which can be computed in a very simple way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot of all of this is that the kernel trick takes advatnage of the fact that SVMs rely only on a dot product over the feature space, rather than individual feature vectors. This allows us to work with immensely complicated feature representations while keeping the actual computation of the SVM very simple. For a more in depth look at kernels (and SVMs in general), the [Stanford ML notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes3.pdf) are a great resource.   "
