What better way to improve your accuracy than to look at the errors that you made and figure out how to fix them? It's very hard to understand why you are making errors in many models, especially SVMs and neural nets, and this model is much easier.\n",

    "#### How do we construct decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, how can we construct these decision trees in cases when we aren't experts and know the correct splits beforehand? It turns out that there are a lot of different ways, most notably (today) CART (Classification and Regression Trees) and C5.0 (some people refer to this as ID3's successor). Let's look at a simplified version of the CART algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to solve the classification problem of deciding whether animals are `good` or `bad` (regression is similar) and we have a labeled data set of the form \n",
    "$$S = \\{(\\vec{x}, y)_i\\}_{i = 1}^n$$\n",
    "Where $\\vec{x}$ is written with an arrow to emphasize that it is a vector of features, $x_i[0]$, $x_i[1]$, ...etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to construct the tree in a top-down approach - that is, we're going to start at the top, create a node, and then walk downwards, creating more nodes as we go. Suppose that we want to branch on feature $k$, and there are two possible values for feature $k$ (which is a label, rather than a continuous variable), `cat` and `dog`. If we split based on feature $k$, we'll have two clumps of data, $S_{\\operatorname{cat}}$, and $S_{\\operatorname{dog}}$. How can we tell whether this is a good split? We'll look at two metrics to evaluate how to choose $k$ at every step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gini Impurity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gini impurity** is a measure of the *mixiness* of a set. If a set of points is really pure (i.e. 100% one label or 100% another label) the Gini impurity will be low. For a given set $S$ (say, $S' = S_{\\operatorname{cat}}$) we first get the fraction $f_{\\operatorname{good}}$ of $S'$ that consists of `good` and the fraction $f_{\\operatorname{bad}}$ that is `bad`. More generally, let the labels be $i = [0, 1, 2, ... k]$, and we calculate $f_i$ for all $i$. Then,\n",
    "$$I_G(S') = \\sum_{i = 0}^k f_i(1 - f_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: as a function of each $f_i$s, $I_G$ is maximized whenever $f_i = 0$ or $f_i = 1$ (i.e. when the set is the most pure).*\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to choose the best feature to branch on, we just choose whichever reduces the total Gini impurity the most ($I_G(S_{\\operatorname{cat}}) + I_G(S_{\\operatorname{dog}})$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: if our branch factor is `breed`, and the set of cats contains 45 good cats and 15 bad cats, and the set of dogs contains 60 good dogs and only 5 bad dogs, the overall Gini impurity of the split is:\n",
    "$$I_G = \\left(\\frac{45}{105}\\cdot\\frac{60}{105} + \\frac{15}{20}\\cdot\\frac{5}{20}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{60}{105}\\cdot\\frac{45}{105} + \\frac{5}{20}\\cdot\\frac{15}{20}\\right) = 0.4324$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Question: if you look closely above, the Gini impurity of each of the sets above is the same. Is this always true?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we split based on `color`, and the brown animals were 100 good and 10 bad, and the black animals were 5 good and 10 bad, then the Gini impurity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_G = \\left(\\frac{100}{105}\\cdot\\frac{5}{105} + \\frac{10}{20}\\cdot\\frac{10}{20}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{5}{105}\\cdot\\frac{100}{105} + \\frac{10}{20}\\cdot\\frac{100}{20}\\right) = 0.2954$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we'd choose to branch based on `color`, which makes some intuitive sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Information Gain\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Gini impurity, information gain is another metric. Basically, for any mixed up set we can measure it's [Shannon entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory), which is a measure of randomness. So, at each stage we try to reduce the entropy by as much as possible. However, given a piece of information $I$, the difference in entropy before knowing $I$ (e.g. the value of a feature) and the entropy afterwards is called the **information gain**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_E(S') = -\\sum_{i = 0}^k f_i \\cdot \\log k_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What about regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "If our output isn't class labels (i.e., `good` or `bad`), then what are we supposed to do? Fall back on our old friend, mean squared error! We find a mean for each of the target nodes, and then calculate the overall reduction in mean squared error."
