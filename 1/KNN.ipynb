    "kNN is a very easy algorithm to understand. However, there are several major drawbacks. First off, notice that KNN does not find an explicit function mapping inputs to outputs, like regression does. Instead, it searches through the dataset to find the neighbors. This forces us to store the entire training dataset. In addition, the process of traversing the dataset can be very expensive for large datasets. Finally, as we saw earlier, choosing the correct value of k is crucial to getting a high performing algorithm."
