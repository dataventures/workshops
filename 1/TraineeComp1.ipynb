    "In supervised learning, the model defines the effect one set of observations, called inputs, has on another set of observations, called outputs. We are given a dataset with response variables and predictor variables and use this to try to come up with a function that maps predictor variables to response variables. We assume that there is some true mapping function $f$, and try to come up with an approximation $\\hat f$ so that given new data, we can make accurate predictions.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data and no corresponding output variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data. These are called unsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning above there is no correct answers and there is no teacher. Algorithms are left on their own to discover interesting structure and patterns in the data.\n",

The predictor variables are the ones that we have at our disposal to try to determine the outcome variable. We usually label the number of predictor variables as $p$, and we call the $i$th instance of the $j$th predictor variable $X_{i,j}$. We call the $i$th instance of the response variable $Y_i$. Generally we write $Y = f(X) + \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ represents the true error of the relationship between $X$ and $Y$, which is impossible to predict. \n",

This is to prevent overfitting, where our predictive model is taking into account fluctuations due to the irreducible error ($\\epsilon$) in the dataset rather than solely the function $f$ that relates $X$ (predictors) and $Y$ (response). Because of this, it's important to validate our model by testing it on a dataset other than the training set. \n",
