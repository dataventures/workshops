    "Clustering is an unsupervised method that tries to find structure in a set of objects. Specifically, we want to find clusters, groups within our object set where objects in a cluster are more similar to each other than they are to objects outside of the cluster. Note that this definition is quite vague - there are many different ways to conceptualize how clusters may occur in data, and today we will look at K-Means and hierarchical clustering in particular."

This gives us the total reconstruction error, the sum of all the individual reconstruction errors, as an error value that we want to minimize. \n",

    "SKLearn has a K-Means implementation that is documented [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html). In this example, we use K-Means to classify flowers into 3 classes based on their properties. Note that choosing the right $k$ is crucial. The true number of categories within the dataset is 3, so with this knowlegde, we can let $k$ be 3 to get the most logical split. However, if we didn't know that the dataset consisted of three types of flowers, choosing $k$ to be a value like 7 might result in less logical clusters."

    "K-Means is one of the most common and simple clustering methods, but it has a couple of key limitations. First off, it is nondeterministic as it depends on the initial choice of cluster means, and Lloyd's Algorithm only arrives upon local minima rather than the global minimum. Furthermore, the algorithm requires you to decide what $k$ is, as we saw earlier. Finally, K-Means can be inflexible, as the only way cluster centers are derived is through the mean distance from all of the points assigned to the cluster. Because of this construction, K-Means doesn't perform well on clusters that are connected but not compact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering solves many of these issues. The motivation between hierarchical clustering is building up clusters as a hierarchy. All objects start out in their individual groups, and at each level, the groups that are a certain distance apart are joined to form a larger group. A variety of different distance metrics can be used in building up these groups to result in different types of hierarchical clusters. "

Tune parameters and look at the different options to try and get your clusters as close to the ground truth as possible. This challenge hopes to help you familiarize yourself with the documentation that SKLearn provides and figure out the best clustering method given a problem to solve. We only covered two clustering models in depth to give you a taste of what clustering can do, but there many more clustering models out there all with their own optimal use cases."
